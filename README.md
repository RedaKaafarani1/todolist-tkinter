# TODO list using Tkinter

A simple GUI app written in Python using Tkinter. The app presents a simple interface where the user can create a new user to add some elements to his todo list. The data is saved in a json format and loaded if found.

## How to run?

Since tkinter is a part of Python, no need to install any library. The code can be directly cloned and executed 
```bash
python3 src/app.py
```
## TODO
1. Add ability to delete todos
2. Add ability to modify todos
3. Some code cleanup
4. Maybe better seperation between the functions? (i.e. in different files? not sure, for a small app like this...)
